        <li><b>Editing:</b> One of my favorite hobbies is video editing, I've been editing videos since I was 13 years old. My main style of editing is story telling through 2d and stop motion images to move entities in the edits. I also have created edits on some of my favortite such as Sentinel Prime, and Bumbleebee. </li>
        <li><b>Drone Flying:</b> Every now and then especially over the summer I would go out and fly my drone around. when flying my drone I would get really high and take pictueres of the Downtown Raleigh Skyline.</li>
        <li><b>Coding:</b>I like to code, I code or am looking at code almost everyday in the week either its at school or at home. My favorite programing languges are Python, Lua, and HTML. I also enjoy watching youtube videos on people coding videos games in C++.</li>
