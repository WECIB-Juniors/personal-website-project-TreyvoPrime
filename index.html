        Some of my hobbies are editing, coding, gaming, flying drones, and basketball. I hope to advance my drone flying skills and pursue a potential secondary career path in flying drones. I have a DJI-Mini drone that I use every now and then to take pictures of my surrondings.
        Some of my favorite tv shows and movies are Transfomers Dark of the Moon, Transformers Age of Extinction, Transformers The Last Knight, Transformers one, Godzilla, and How To Train your Dragon: Race to the Edge.
        My favorite foods are Pizza, fried chicken, Pasta, and pineapples. Fruits are also really yummy to me and I eat them everyday.

        I wake up every morning as my best self, I try to eat well, sleep well, and have good habits overall. I like to game as I stated eariler, Some of my favorite games are Hearts of Iron 4, Victoria 3, Age of History 2, Roblox, and Minecraft.
        Age of History 2 is my most steam game on this list with 500 hours on it. A new grand strategy game just came out named Europa Universalis 5 I'll be getting the game soon, and I bet I'll enjoy it.
        I hope to continue playing new games in the genres that I like, and I hope new games are still being made in genre's I like and keep enjoying life.
